Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

We created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations provided from past assignment: weather data.

We created 7 pages in total:

 1)A landing page containing:
    -An explanation of the project.
    -Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.

2)Four visualization pages: Temperature, Wind Speed, Cloudiness & Humidity each with:
-A descriptive title and heading tag.
-The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
-A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

3)A "Comparisons" page that:
-Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
-Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
-The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.

4)A "Data" page that:
-Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
-The table must be a bootstrap table component. Hint
-The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML. 

Also, The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:
-Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
-Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
-Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
-Is responsive (using media queries). The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots "Navigation Menu" section (notice the background color change).
